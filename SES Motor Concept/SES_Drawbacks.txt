One significant drawback of SES motors is their higher initial cost, which may be a barrier for industries with limited budgets. The advanced technology required for integrating sensors, electronics, and the ability to function as both an actuator and a position sensor adds complexity and expense to the motor. This could make SES motors less attractive for cost-sensitive applications, where traditional motors might be preferred due to their simpler design and lower production costs. While the motor offers long-term energy savings, the upfront investment may not always justify the benefits for every application.

Another potential drawback of SES motors is their reliance on integrated electronics and sensors, which could be a vulnerability in harsh environments. In sectors where exposure to extreme temperatures, vibrations, or other challenging conditions is common, the internal components of the motor may be prone to malfunction. Such conditions could compromise the motor's performance and lifespan, making it less suitable for certain industrial or outdoor applications where robustness and durability are essential. Furthermore, the complexity introduced by these internal systems may require specialized maintenance, which can lead to higher operational costs over time.
